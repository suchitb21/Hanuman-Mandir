      <h2 class="section-title">Our History</h2>
        <p class="section-desc">Tilaknagar emerged as a housing colony in 1954, when MHADA envisioned dignified homes for Mumbai’s working class. Life then was governed by strict rules, even simple home modifications required permission. Yet, amidst these limitations, residents nurtured a shared desire for spiritual comfort, unity, and a sacred space they could call their own.</p>

        <p class="section-desc">Driven by faith and perseverance, a group of respected seniors took responsibility for building a Mandir within the colony. Despite resistance, legal hurdles, and repeated demolition attempts under police supervision, the community stood united. Their unwavering belief in Lord Hanuman transformed struggle into strength and preserved the Mandir’s sanctity.</p>

        <p class="section-desc">Today, this Mandir stands as one of Tilaknagar’s oldest and most revered spiritual landmarks. Its enduring presence reflects the deep faith of countless devotees who find peace, hope, and emotional grounding here. The Mandir has grown not just in structure, but in hearts, devotion, and collective belonging.</p>

Events include mass Laghurudra, palkhi processions, bhajans, cultural programs, Garba, Jagrata, and community favorites like the Tilaknagar Home Minister, creating joy for all generations.</p>

        <p class="section-desc">Beyond devotion, the Mandir actively serves society through satsangs, Baal Sanskaar, and initiatives like the Renuka Vadhuwar Mandal, offering marriage support and free counseling.
